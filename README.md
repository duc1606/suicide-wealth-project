# Suicide Rate and Economic Well-Being Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between a country's economic well-being and its suicide rates. By analyzing data from various sources including GDP and suicide statistics, we aim to understand whether wealthier nations experience higher incidences of suicide. This analysis is crucial for developing effective mental health policies and interventions.

## Data Sources
- **Suicide Rates:** Kaggle dataset (1985-2016)
- **GDP Data:** World Bank (2018)
- **HDI Data:** United Nations Development Program (2018)
- **Additional Information:** CIA World Factbook, World Health Organization

## Key Questions
- How does the suicide rate change with the wealth of a country?
- What other factors influence suicide rates beyond economic indicators?

## Methodology
Data from different sources are combined, cleaned, and analyzed to reveal patterns and correlations. Visualizations are created to illustrate the findings and highlight significant trends.
